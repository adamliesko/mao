## M훮o

Minimalistic BDD Testing Framework For Go.

```go
import "math"

Desc("math.Abs", func(it It) {
  it("returns the absolute value of x", func(expect Expect) {
    expect(math.Abs(-12)).Equal(12.0)
    expect(math.Abs(-.5)).Equal(0.5)
  })
})
```

## Why M훮o?

* **No restrictions.** You can create your test file anywhere.
* **Don't repeat yourself:** M훮o does the ceremony for you by preprocessing the test module.
* **Minimalistic Output:** M훮o doesn't have verbose outputs. It'll output quite short and briefly, will show you what lines fail in case of any error.

## Install

Install the Go library first;

```bash
$ go install github.com/azer/mao
```

And optionally, install the command-line tool to avoid the boilerplate code: *See examples/simple-with-boilerplate.go if you'd like to skip this step*

```bash
$ curl https://raw.github.com/azer/mao/master/install | sh
```

## Usage

Create a test module anywhere you want and import the code you'd like to test:

```go
import "math"

Desc("math.Abs", func(it It) {
  it("returns the absolute value of x", func(expect Expect) {
    expect(math.Abs(-12)).Equal(12.0)
    expect(math.Abs(-.5)).Equal(0.5)
  })
})
```

And run it with `mao` command:

```bash
$ mao test.go
```

It'll either output a simple success message that will look like;

```
Ran 3 tests successfully.
```

Or some error messages with failing source code lines, like following;
